{"name": "Bard", "type": "class", "img": "icons/tools/instruments/lute-gold-brown.webp", "system": {"description": {"value": "<p>Our connection to the world is ultimately filtered through our experience of it. What then, could be a greater power than to be able to shape those experiences yourself? Stories are not simply just a litany of words, they are the very framework through which our minds try to grasp and make meaning of the past, the future, and even the present.</p><p>To elevate these experiences, echoing the stories of the past into the now and weaving the present into a story that will live ever in legend - that is the calling of the Bard. Theirs is a thrifty craft, pulling bits of arcana, skillful performances, and gripping storytelling into a single art. Though bards possess a basic understanding of the arcane, it should not be mistaken for the source of their powers. To them, it is but one technique in their arsenal and finds its place alongside others like skillful misdirection and mastery of verse and meter. The true source of a bard&rsquo;s power reveals itself when they deploy all of these techniques in tandem to craft their own narrative, drawing onlookers in by their untapped imagination and unconscious interpretation of unfolding events. It is precisely this state, where the boundary between fact and fiction has become blurred, that enables a bard to coax their marvelous acts into actual being; manifesting stories and ideas into reality as its own form of magic.</p><p>Whether by choice or not, it&rsquo;s been known to happen for a Bard to find that whilst they were busy expounding upon the tales of yore, they&rsquo;ve been swept into a newly unfolding tale themself. With their abilities to support and empower allies as well as to confuse and frustrate foes, a Bard is a welcome addition to any adventuring party - especially any party looking to make its name known.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Bard Multiclass Proficiencies</h3><p>When you multiclass, you do not gain all the proficiencies from the classes that you are multiclassing into.&nbsp; Instead you gain the following proficiencies by class.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Multiclassing Proficiencies Table</em></p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Class</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Proficiencies Gained</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Bard</p></td><td><p>Light and Medium Armor, the Entertainment Trade, and one skill of your choice.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Quick Build</h3><p>If you are looking to play a Bard as quickly as possible, consider the following:</p><ul><li>Presence should be one of your highest Attributes.</li><li>Your choices for your next highest Attributes depends on your plan of action.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><ul><li>If you&rsquo;d like to inspire your friends while diving headfirst into the brawl yourself, choose either Dexterity or Strength, followed by Constitution.</li><li>If you&rsquo;d like to be a jack of all trades who pulls the strings from a distance, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Dexterity are all strong options.
