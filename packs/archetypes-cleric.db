For some, dragons are like unto a class of divine beings of their own - demigods of flesh, blood, and flame to be showered with all the appropriate praise and offerings. To others, they represent an ideal to strive towards - a powerful body infused with magical power, complete with timeless wisdom. Whatever the motivation, it's common for Dragon Clerics to try to emulate their idols in some way, be it in mannerism, appearance, or both.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who have yet to meet a Cleric of the Dragon Dominion might expect them all to be crazed cultists willing to cast aside their morality for a taste of destructive power. While the sort power and riches boasted by dragons is always bound to draw sycophants, know that the path of the Dragon Dominion Cleric is no small undertaking. Learning to wield the raw power of the elements and live up to the ancient legacy of the dragons is bound to change a Cleric. For all those who may come to believe that might makes right, there are just as many who take after dragonkind's more wisened or benevolent examples.</p><h4>Dragon Dominion Proficiencies</h4><p>If this Divine Dominion is taken during character creation, you gain the following additional proficiencies:</p><p><strong>Weapons:</strong>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>(a) two simple weapons, or (b) a martial weapon</li><li>One crossbow (light, hand, heavy, or repeating)</li></ul><p><strong>Save Checks:</strong> Constitution</p><p><strong>Skills and Trades:</strong> Choose one of the following skills or trades to be proficient in: Intimidation, Athletics, Instinct, Culture, Tinkering Trade (Jeweler).<br /><br /></p><h4>Dragon Dominion Equipment</h4><p>If this Divine Dominion is taken during character creation, you gain the following additional equipment:</p><ul><li>(a) a simple weapon, (b) a pike (if proficient), or (c) a lance (if proficient).</li><li>(a) a simple ranged weapon and 20 ammunition, or (b) a repeating crossbow and 20 bolts (if proficient).</li></ul><p>Alternate Rule: Instead of taking any equipment from this section, instead take 2d4 x 10gp and spend it on items from the equipment section.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anything bought this way cannot be magical, with the exception of magical foci, and no equipment can be modified mechanically from their base state.</p>", "chat": "", "unidentified": ""}, "source": "Core Rules", "identifier": "cleric-dragon", "classIdentifier": "cleric", "classDetails": "<h3>Divine Dominion: Dragon Dominion</h3><hr/><h3>Dragon Dominion Starter Abilities</h3><p>As your first level in this dominion, you gain all of the following abilities: </p><hr/><p>Starter Abilities: @Compendium[undertaking-homebrew.abilities.T15IEHRWISA9JGIO]{Number of the Dragon}, @Compendium[undertaking-homebrew.abilities.UROYUWYQ5D1XOMRC]{Elemental Affinity}, @Compendium[undertaking-homebrew.abilities.PF2GG3QRNRTNOXYS]{Dominion Spells}, @Compendium[undertaking-homebrew.abilities.BP376DKTF70JKEHV]{Fearsome Presence}, @Compendium[undertaking-homebrew.abilities.CUTXVGMQ0RG5EE7O]{Mantras of the Dragon}</p><hr/><h3>Dragon Dominion Abilities</h3><p>When taking a level in Dragon Dominion after your first, you may choose from the following abilities: </p><hr/><p>Options: @Compendium[undertaking-homebrew.abilities.JKVO726WWVKAVE2W]{Hoarded Blessings}, @Compendium[undertaking-homebrew.abilities.D1GJLP59RK0A613P]{Covetous Defiance}, @Compendium[undertaking-homebrew.abilities.4RLLUUNYF7O4NQJ6]{Purloined Essence}, @Compendium[undertaking-homebrew.abilities.DF3V1QA5MH23X8LZ]{Miracles of Draconic Transubstantiation}</p>"}, "effects": [], "folder": null, "sort": 0, "ownership": {"default": 0}, "flags": {}, "_id": "DRGNL8BGELQQ9QAY", "_stats": {"systemId": "undertaking", "systemVersion": "1.0.0", "coreVersion": "11.304"}}
