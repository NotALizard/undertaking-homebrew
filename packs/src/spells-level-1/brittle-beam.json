            "value": "<p>A corrosive beam of harsh light streaks from your finger toward a target, depositing a thin coating of acid wherever it touches. Make a ranged spell attack against either a creature or an object that is not being worn or carried.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the spell attack hits a creature, it takes 3d8 acid damage and the acid mars its worn or wielded equipment or natural weapons. The first time the creature hits with a weapon attack with any of these weapons before the start of your next turn, it must subtract your spellcasting attribute modifier (minimum 1) from the damage it deals.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the spell attack hits an object, it takes 3d8 acid damage and is vulnerable to the damage of the next weapon attack that hits it.<br><br>Charge: This is a spell that can be Charged, modifying its effects. Costs and effects are as follow: <ul><li>1 Mana: The acid damage increases to 6d8 against objects. </li><li>3 Mana: The acid damage increases to 6d8. </li><li>1 Mana: On a hit, you can choose to concentrate on the spell for up to 1 minute, causing the acid to cling more harshly than before. While you maintain concentration, subtract your spellcasting attribute modifier (minimum 1) from the damage of all weapon attacks the creature makes. </li></ul></p>",
