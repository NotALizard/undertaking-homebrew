            "value": "<p>You attempt to dazzle a creature, drawing it into a lull and instilling it with an irresistible compulsion to come closer. It must make a Wisdom (Save) check, and does so with advantage if you or your companions are fighting it. If it fails the saving throw, it is @Compendium[undertaking.conditions.KJXJ0T5RPNC51N4V]{Charmed} by you until the spell ends or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it.</p><p>While the creature is @Compendium[undertaking.conditions.KJXJ0T5RPNC51N4V]{Charmed} by this spell, it cannot willingly move further away from you. On each of your turns, you can use a minor action to compel a creature under the spell&rsquo;s effect to immediately move up to half its speed closer to you. The creature avoids hazardous terrain to the best of its ability and stops moving if it reaches a point where there is no safe terrain to proceed along.</p><p>Charge: This is a spell that can be Charged, modifying its effects. Costs and effects are as follow:</p><ul><li>1 Mana: You can target an additional creature.</li><li>2 Mana: While the target is @Compendium[undertaking.conditions.KJXJ0T5RPNC51N4V]{Charmed} by this spell, it must make a Wisdom (Save) check at the start of each of its turns. On a failure, the target is @Compendium[undertaking.conditions.3CQC3JEY2C3Y721F]{Incapacitated} until the start of its next turn.</li><li>3 Mana: You can target two additional creatures.</li></ul>",
