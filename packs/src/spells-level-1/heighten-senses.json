For the duration the target has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) and Wisdom (Instinct) checks where the chosen sense is applicable. This also has the effect of granting them a +5 bonus to Awareness in situations where the enhanced sense would apply.</p><p>Charge:&nbsp;This is a spell that can be Charged, modifying its effects. Costs and effects are as follow:</p><ul><li>1 Mana: You enhance all five senses instead of just one, but the spell requires all five material components if you don&rsquo;t have a focus.</li><li>1 Mana: You additionally gain a sixth sense, allowing the target to sense the presence of @Compendium[undertaking.conditions.YE63H7VLOHW7NFHO]{Invisible}&nbsp;creatures within 30ft of them, whether corporeal or metaphysical. While the target cannot actually see the creature, the Invisible condition does not grant any benefits against the target.</li></ul>",
