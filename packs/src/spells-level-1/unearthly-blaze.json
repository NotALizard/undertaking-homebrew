            "value": "<p>Invoking the name of an otherworldly realm or being that is celestial or fiendish in nature, you call forth a conflagration of ghostly flame that fills a 15ft cube centered on a point you can see within range. You choose what unnatural color the flames are and if they deal cold or fire damage. Each creature inside the area must make a Dexterity (Save) check. On a failed save the creature takes 2d8 damage of the chosen type, or half damage on a successful save.</p><p>Charge: This is a spell that can be Charged, modifying its effects. Costs and effects are as follow:</p><ul><li>1 Mana: The flames burn brilliantly. The damage increases by 1d8 and you can choose for its type to be radiant instead.</li><li>1 Mana: The flames rage furiously. The damage type is changed to chaos.</li></ul>",
