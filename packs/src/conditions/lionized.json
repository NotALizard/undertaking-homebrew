Once per turn the lionized creature can add a bonus 1d4 to the result of an attack roll or check that uses the chosen attribute.&nbsp;</li><li>While a lionized creature is performing a desperate action, it can choose to take advantage on one roll at the cost of the lionized effect ending at the end of the desperate action.</li><li>The die increases in size at the second growth level, becoming a d6 at 11th level.</li></ul><p>Lionized does not stack. If a creature gains the lionized effect while already lionized, the effect with the longer duration remains. When this happens, it can also change which attribute is affected.</p>",
