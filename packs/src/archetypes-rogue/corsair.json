The tales of their voyages are filled to the brim with daring acts of piracy and enviable riches, along with a hearty serving of betrayal. Even with such dangers, the life of the Corsair calls to any Rogue with a spark of wanderlust and adventure in their soul. To truly succeed as a Corsair, one needs not just a capable crew but also the charm and daring to lead them, else the ever-present whispers of avarice may begin to stir mutiny in their hearts of those you rely on most.</p>",
