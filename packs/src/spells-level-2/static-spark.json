            "value": "<p>You hurl a ball of electricity at a creature within range, making a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 2d10 lightning damage and becomes charged with static electricity. On a miss, the spell ends. For the duration, you can use your action to make a ranged spell attack against any other creature within 15 feet of the charged creature, dealing 2d6 lightning damage on a hit.</p><p>Charge: This is a spell that can be Charged, modifying its effects. Costs and effects are as follow:</p><ul><li>1 Mana: If you miss the initial spell attack, the spell does not end and the target creature&rsquo;s space becomes charged with electricity instead. The rest of the spell functions as normal but with the words &ldquo;charged creature&rdquo; replaced with &ldquo;charged space&rdquo;.</li><li>1 Mana: Instead of making a spell attack, you can touch a willing creature to harmlessly charge them with electricity instead. The spell functions as normal, skipping the initial attack damage.</li><li>4 Mana: The subsequent spell attacks can be triggered as a minor action.</li></ul>",
