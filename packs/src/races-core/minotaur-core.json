      "value": "<p>Minotaurs are bipedal beings reminiscent of humans, though unlike humans they have a head resembling a bull's, hooved feet, and a covering of short, bovine fur. Minotaur fur generally comes in shades of brown, white, black, or a mixture of those colors. Regardless of whether they are male or female, the head of a minotaur is adorned with a formidable pair of bull-like horns. Their bodies also tend to have a larger build than humans, with the average minotaur sharing a height with some of the tallest humans.</p>",
