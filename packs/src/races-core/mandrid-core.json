      "value": "<p>Mandrids are bipedal humanoids that, strangely enough, resemble any one of a variety of salamanders walking upright. They are slightly shorter and stockier on average than humans, and they have a tail that extends behind them by roughly their height. Like salamanders, they are fully amphibious and dwell on land as often as beneath the water. Their skin is smooth and perpetually moist to the touch, save for when they are extremely dehydrated.</p>",
