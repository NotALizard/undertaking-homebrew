On a failed save, the creature must include you as a target for any attacks and harmful spells or abilities it attempts until the end of its next turn. This effect only restricts the creature&rsquo;s valid targets, it does not (on its own) provoke hostility from a creature that otherwise would not be inclined to harm you.</p><p>Succeed or fail, for the next minute the creature has disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks to perceive creatures other than you while it is able to see you. This effect immediately ends if the creature is attacked or harmed.</p>",
