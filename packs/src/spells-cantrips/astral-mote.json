            "value": "<p>You draw radiant energy into a little mote of light and direct it towards a target within range, making the mote streak through the air like a shooting star. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 radiant damage.</p><p>&nbsp;If you cast this spell from a space that has an unobstructed view to the sky above, you can choose to have the mote originate from the sky instead of your hand. When you do, the damage die increases to 1d12 and the attack originates from the sky above the target for the purposes of determining what cover they benefit from.</p><p>Charge: This is a spell that can be Charged, modifying its effects. Costs and effects are as follow:</p><ul><li>1 Mana: On a hit, the target sheds 10 feet of dim light until the end of your next turn. For this duration, being @Compendium[undertaking.conditions.YE63H7VLOHW7NFHO]{Invisible} does not grant the target any benefits as its silhouette glows.</li><li>1 Mana: Create an additional mote, directing the attack towards the same or a different creature within range.</li><li>2 Mana: Create two additional motes, directing the attacks towards the same or different creatures within range.</li></ul>",
