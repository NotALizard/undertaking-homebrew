            "value": "<p>With a flourish of magic and a short prescription you magically alter the scenery to better fit your creative vision. You create one of the following effects within range:</p><ul><li>You alter the text present on an object to say something else or render it illegible. This effect lasts one hour. A creature can perceive the unaltered version of the text with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.</li><li>You instantly clean or bloodstain one surface, worn garment, or medium or smaller object. A creature can determine the blood created by this effect to be fake with a successful Wisdom (Medicine) check against your spell save DC.</li><li>You create the sound of a voice speaking a single word, or any other short non-verbal sound such as thunder, an animal noise, or a crowd&rsquo;s cheer. The sound originates from a point you can see within range. A creature can determine that the sound is an imitation with a successful Wisdom (Insight) check against your spell save DC.</li><li>You create an image no larger than 15 feet in any dimension and styled like a painting on one undecorated surface within range such as a blank sheet of parchment or plain wall. When viewed from up close, the image appears to be hastily made and lacking artistry.</li><li>You instantly light or snuff a single non-magical light source such as a candle, lantern, chandelier, or small campfire. You can also dim a light source for 1 hour, suppressing the dim light emitted by it and reducing its bright light to dim light.</li></ul>",
