While you have a free hand, you can use your minor action to <strong>Shove</strong> or <strong>Trip</strong> a creature. Creatures you successfully <strong>Trip</strong> take 1d6 bludgeoning damage when they hit the ground.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, when you are initiating or resisting an attempt to <strong>Shove</strong> or <strong>Trip</strong>, you can make a Presence (Perform) check in place of the normal check.</p>",
