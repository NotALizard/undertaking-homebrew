You can augment your <strong>Assist</strong> action in the following ways:</p><ul><li>When you take the <strong>Assist</strong> action, you can make a single weapon attack as a minor action. If you <strong>Commit to the Bit</strong>, you can choose to delay this attack until you are within range of a target on the assisted creature&rsquo;s turn.</li><li>When you take the <strong>Assist</strong> action, you can use your minor action to cast a cantrip with a normal casting time of one action. If you <strong>Commit to the Bit</strong>, you can instead use your minor action to cast a 1st level spell with a normal casting time of one action. A 1st level spell cast in this way can only affect you, the assisted creature, and objects carried by either of you.</li></ul>",
