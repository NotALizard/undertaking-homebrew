Once per turn, immediately after swinging at least 10 feet on a rope or chain, your first weapon attack against a target that is within 5 feet of you gains advantage.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, you can climb ropes and chains at your normal walking speed and can perform Long Jumps off of them as handily as from the ground (Refer to &lsquo;Jumping&rsquo; in <strong>&ldquo;Chapter 7: Combat&rdquo;</strong>). Each turn, the first 10 feet of horizontal movement you make while swinging costs you no movement.</p><p>You also learn the following Gambits:&nbsp;@Compendium[undertaking-homebrew.abilities.OB8YW767NKUR0TXY]{Gambit: Weigh Anchor}, @Compendium[undertaking-homebrew.abilities.0LCC8YZ2VZB77YR9]{Gambit: Getting Yer Sea Legs}</p>",
