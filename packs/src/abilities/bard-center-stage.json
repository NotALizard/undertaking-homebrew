While a creature is inside the light, it is @Compendium[undertaking-homebrew.conditions.ZOBZ8V2YME5YOYZR]{&#x1F981; Lionized} if it is an ally to you or @Compendium[undertaking-homebrew.conditions.WHN3T2G6R8HUKOQX]{&#x1F9FF; Villainized} if it is hostile to you. Until the ability ends, you can use either your action or 1 @Compendium[undertaking-homebrew.abilities.ZVH8L715PTWTQLSE]{&#x2728; Flair} point and a minor action to move the cylinder of light to another point you can see within 60 ft of you.</p>",
