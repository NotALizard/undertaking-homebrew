If the chosen creature is ahead of you in the initiative order, move yourself to the spot immediately after it in the initiative order. Otherwise, move the creature to the spot immediately before you in the initiative order.</p><p>Subtract any movement used by this ability from the movement available to you on your first turn of combat.
