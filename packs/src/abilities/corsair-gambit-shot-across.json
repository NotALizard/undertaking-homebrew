      "value": "<p><strong>Gambit: Shot Across the Bow</strong></p><p><em>Cost: 1 Panache</em></p><p>When you miss a creature with a ranged attack that would have been eligible for Sneak Attack, you can expend your use of Sneak Attack this turn and one Panache Die to turn the attack into a warning shot. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom (Save) Check against your Sneak Attack DC or take psychic damage equal to a roll of the Panache Die and become @Compendium[undertaking.conditions.UK95BQ45TGSD5Q3V]{Frightened} of you until the end of its next turn. A creature that would be reduced to 0 hit points by this damage faints instead, dropping to 1 hit point and falling @Compendium[undertaking.conditions.9KB959MRZ0H4IT4C]{Unconscious} for 1 minute.</p>",
