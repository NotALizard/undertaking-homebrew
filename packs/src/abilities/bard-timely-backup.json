Unlike other desperate actions, you can use this ability to interrupt the desperate actions of willing creatures.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, onlookers may become annoyed if you keep inserting yourself into pivotal moments in this way. Each time you use this ability again before your next short rest, become @Compendium[undertaking-homebrew.conditions.WHN3T2G6R8HUKOQX]{&#x1F9FF; Villainized} until the end of your next turn. You only suffer from the baseline effects of being villainized, not any other abilities you have that would apply to creatures you've villainized.",
