Before applying the effects of a roll to determine healing given to a creature or damage dealt to a genuine adversary, you can choose to hoard a single rolled die. Add that die&rsquo;s result to your Spiritual Hoard, and then set the die to a 1. The affected die does not count towards effects that trigger upon rolling one or more of a specific number, such as Eikonic Numbers or Miracles.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the total of your Spiritual Hoard equals or exceeds 25, you can subtract 25 from it to trigger a Miracle as a non-action on your turn.</p>",
