These fragments are yours to keep and form your own personal reserve that grows and grows until its power cannot be contained.</p><p>You have a <strong>Spiritual Hoard</strong> number, an accumulating value that starts at 0. Each time you roll one or more @Compendium[undertaking.abilities.65D4NMYRBMKHW59K]{ðŸ•¯ Faith} Dice but do not trigger a Miracle, you may increase your Spiritual Hoard by the number rolled on one of the @Compendium[undertaking.abilities.65D4NMYRBMKHW59K]{ðŸ•¯ Faith} Dice. If this causes the new total of your Spiritual Hoard to equal exceed 20, reset your Spiritual Hoard to 0 and immediately trigger a Miracle.</p>",
