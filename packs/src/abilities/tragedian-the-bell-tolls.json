As a reaction to the death of a creature you can see, you can single out another creature within 20ft of it to instill terror into. If the target can hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom (Save) check versus your spell save DC or become @Compendium[undertaking.conditions.UK95BQ45TGSD5Q3V]{Frightened} by the sight of the corpse until the end of its next turn. Succeed or fail, the target can't be affected by this ability again until 24 hours have passed.</p>",
