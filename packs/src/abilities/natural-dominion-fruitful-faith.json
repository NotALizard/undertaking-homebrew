Any creature that is holding one of these fruits can use its minor action to eat the fruit, regaining hit points equal to 2d4 + your Wisdom modifier. If you can see a creature when it eats a fruit created by this ability, you can use your reaction to spend any number of @Compendium[undertaking.abilities.65D4NMYRBMKHW59K]{&#x1F56F; Faith} Dice and add them to the number rolled. When you finish a long rest, any fruits you created that have not been eaten decay. They lose their magic and you regain a @Compendium[undertaking.abilities.65D4NMYRBMKHW59K]{&#x1F56F; Faith} Die for each.</p>",
